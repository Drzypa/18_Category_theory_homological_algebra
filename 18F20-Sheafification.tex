\begin{document}
Let $F$ be a presheaf over a topological space $X$ with values in a category $\A$ for which sheaves are defined. The {\em sheafification} of $F$, if it exists, is a sheaf $F'$ over $X$ together with a morphism $\theta: F \lra F'$ satisfying the following universal property:

\begin{quotation}
For any sheaf $G$ over $X$ and any morphism of presheaves $\phi: F \lra G$ over $X$, there exists a unique morphism of sheaves $\psi: F' \lra G$ such that the diagram
$$
\xymatrix{
F \ar[r]^{\theta} \ar@/_1pc/[rr]_{\phi} & F' \ar[r]^{\psi} & G
}
$$
commutes.
\end{quotation}
In light of the universal property, the sheafification of $F$ is uniquely defined up to canonical isomorphism whenever it exists. In the case where $\A$ is a concrete category (one consisting of sets and set functions), the sheafification of any presheaf $F$ can be constructed by taking $F'(U)$ to be the set of all functions $s: U \lra \bigcup_{p \in U} F_p$ such that
\begin{enumerate}
\item $s(p) \in F_p$ for all $p \in U$
\item For all $p \in U$, there is a neighborhood $V \subset U$ of $p$ and a section $t \in F(V)$ such that, for all $q \in V$, the induced element $t_q \in F_q$ equals $s(q)$
\end{enumerate}
for all open sets $U \subset X$. Here $F_p$ denotes the stalk of the presheaf $F$ at the point $p$.

The following quote, taken from~\cite{mumford}, is perhaps the best explanation of sheafification to be found anywhere:
\begin{quotation}
$F'$ is ``the best possible sheaf you can get from $F$''. It is easy to imagine how to get it: first identify things which have the same restrictions, and then add in all the things which can be patched together.
\end{quotation}
