\begin{document}
Let $\mathcal C$ be a category and $f\in \mathcal C(A,B)$ for some $A,B\in\mathrm Ob(A,B)$. Then $f$ is said to be 
an \emph{epimorphic extension} if it is both an epimorphism and a monorphism.

For instance, in the category of rings we say that a ring $B$ is an epimorphic extension of another ring $A$, if $A$ is a subring of $B$ and the canonical homomorphism between $A$ and $B$ is an epimorphism.
