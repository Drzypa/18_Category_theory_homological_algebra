  Suppose that $f$ is the equalizer of $g$ and $h$ (refer to the commutative
  diagram below).  Let $a,b$ be morphisms such that \[fa=fb=d.\]  We must
  show that $a=b$. Since $d$ equalizes $g$ and $h$, by definition of equalizer
  $c$ is the unique morphsim such that $d=fc$.  Hence, both $a$ and
  $b$ are equal to $c$, and hence equal to each other.
