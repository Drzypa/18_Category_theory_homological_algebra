\begin{theorem}
The categorical direct product can be realized as an example of an inverse limit.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
Suppose we have a direct product of $\{C_i\}_{i\in I}$ for some ($\Univ$) set $I$. 
Consider $I$ as a category whose arrows are only the identity arrows.  Then we can 
define a functor $G$ by $G(i)=C_i$.  It is then clear that the universal property 
of an inverse limit is equivalent to the universal property defining a categorical 
direct product.
\end{proof}

Reversing the arrows, it is also clear that the categorical direct sum is an example of a direct limit.

These results are of interest when one is looking to prove exactness of sums and products in a category: often it is easier to address exactness of direct and inverse limits, and the result then applies to many other constructions as well.
