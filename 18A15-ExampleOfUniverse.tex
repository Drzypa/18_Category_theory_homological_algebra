\begin{document}
The simplest example of a universe consists of all sets gotten by starting with the empty set and repeatedly aggregating sets already known to lie in the universe.  That is to say, starting with $\emptyset$, we first form $\{\emptyset\}$.  Given these two elements of our universe, we can then form 
$\{\{\emptyset\}\}$ and $\{\emptyset,\{\emptyset\}\}$.  Given these four elements,
we then can form $\{\{\{\emptyset\}\}\}$, $\{\emptyset,\{\{\emptyset\}\}\}$, 
$\{\{\emptyset,\{\emptyset\}\}\}$ and several other sets.  We can repeat this process to obtain an infinite collection of finite sets. 

The set considered here also happens to be the set $V_\omega$ in the cumulative hierarchy.
