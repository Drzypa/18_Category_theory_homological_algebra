The category \textbf{Cat} of small categories consists of all small categories as objects, and, functors between small categories as morphisms.  The composition of morphisms in \textbf{Cat} is the functor composition, and, associated with each small category, the identity functor acts as the identity morphism.  Now, \textbf{Cat} is indeed a category, since $\hom(\mathcal{C},\mathcal{D})$, the class of all functors from $\mathcal{C}$ to $\mathcal{D}$ is a set.  The proof of this fact can be found \PMlinkname{here}{FunctorCategory}.

Here are some of the basic properties of \textbf{Cat}:
\begin{enumerate}
\item It has \PMlinkname{arbitrary products}{ProductOfCategories}
\item It has \PMlinkname{arbitrary coproducts}{DisjointUnionOfCategories}
\item Initial object exists: the initial object is the empty category and the associated empty functor.
\item Terminal object exists: the terminal object is any trivial category and the associated constant functor into the trival category.
\item It has pullbacks.  See \PMlinkname{this entry}{ExamplesOfPullbacks}.  So it has equalizers, and therefore, it is complete.
\item however, it does have coequalizers.  This, together with 2 above, shows that it is cocomplete.
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{Remarks}.  
\begin{itemize}
\item
If we replace functors in $\hom(\mathcal{C},\mathcal{D})$ by natural transformations between pairs of functors from $\mathcal{C}$ to $\mathcal{D}$, and composition of morphisms the horizontal composition $\circ$ of natural transformations, then we again end up with a category (provided that both $\mathcal{C}$ and $\mathcal{D}$ are small).  Indeed, every natural transformation $\eta$ between two functors from $\mathcal{C}$ to $\mathcal{D}$ is a set function from the \emph{set} of objects of $\mathcal{C}$ to the \emph{set} of morphisms of $\mathcal{D}$.  As a result, $\hom(\mathcal{C},\mathcal{D})$ is a subcollection of the \emph{set} of \emph{all} functions from $\operatorname{Ob}(\mathcal{C})$ to $\operatorname{Mor}(\mathcal{D})$, and hence a set.  For more detail, please see \PMlinkname{this entry}{CompositionsOfNaturalTransformations}.
\item
In fact, \textbf{Cat} has the structure of a 2-category, where the small categories are the $0$-cells, the functors between them are the $1$-cells, and the natural transformations between parallel functors are the $2$-cells.
\item
If we remove the requirement that each object in \textbf{Cat} be small, then $\hom(\mathcal{C},\mathcal{D})$ may no longer be a set, and we end up with a large category.
\end{itemize}
