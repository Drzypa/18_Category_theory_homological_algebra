\begin{document}
The \emph{Stone-functor} $S: Top^{op} \rightarrow Boo$ (where $Boo$ is the construct of boolean algebras and boolean homomorphisms) assigns to each topological space the boolean algebra of its clopen subsets, and for any continuous map $f: X \rightarrow Y$; i.e. for any morphism $f: Y \rightarrow X$ in $Top^{op}$, $Sf: S(Y) \rightarrow S(X)$ is given by $Sf(Z) = f^{-1}[Z]$.
